                                <p>AND WHEREAS the customer requires travel services, including transportation, accommodation and admission to events, for business and/or pleasure, for him/herself and others;</p>
                                <p>THESE TERMS OF SERVICE (the Terms) will govern the relationship between the Agency and customer, and anyone for whom customer requests Agency make travel arrangements, in relation to the travel arrangements.</p>
                                <p>1. Duration of these Terms</p>
                                <p>These Terms apply to any and all travel arrangements made by Agency for customer, and anyone for whom customer requests Agency make travel arrangements until either Agency or customer provides the other with 30 days &#39;notice of termination. These Terms will then terminate on the thirtieth day after notice is provided, subject to any provision of these Terms that specifically states that it will remain in effect after termination.</p>
                                <p>2. Duties and Recommendations of the Agency</p>
                                <p>Agency shall source travel services based on the information provided by customer for use by customer and anyone for whom customer requests Agency make travel arrangements.</p>
                                <p>Agency directs customer &#39;s attention to the terms and conditions of the suppliers of the travel services being arranged for the customer, including airlines, trains, bus lines, cruise lines, hotels and tour operators, which will govern the contracts that customer and anyone for whom customer requests Agency make travel arrangements, will have with the travel service suppliers and affect customer &#39;s rights.

                                <p>3. Duties &amp;Acknowledgements of the Customer</p>
                                <p>Customer and/or anyone for whom customer requests Agency make travel arrangements, shall verify all details set out on all itineraries and invoices upon receipt from Agency and shall immediately advise Agency of any errors or omissions.</p>
                                <p>Customer shall provide a copy of these Terms and any changes to these Terms to anyone for whom customer requests Agency make travel arrangements.</p>
                                <p>Customer acknowledges that customer and anyone for whom customer requests Agency make travel arrangements, has been directed to review the terms and conditions of the suppliers of the travel services included in the travel arrangements made by Agency, including airlines, trains, bus lines, cruise lines, hotels and tour operators, including baggage allowances, check-in times, age and height restrictions and advised that any questions customer and anyone for whom customer requests Agency make travel arrangements, may have about the travel suppliers &#39;terms and conditions should be addressed to the specific travel service supplier.</p>

                                <p>Customer and anyone for whom customer requests Agency make travel arrangements, shall be responsible to ensure that they have all necessary travel documentation, including a passport (valid until 6 months after the expected return date), visas and parental consents to travel with minors required by any destination to which they are travelling or through which they will transit.</p>
                                <p>Customer and anyone for whom customer requests Agency make travel arrangements, acknowledges that even with the required documentation and information in his/her possession s/he may be refused entry into another country at either the point of departure or arrival.</p>
                                <p>Customer and anyone for whom customer requests Agency make travel arrangements, acknowledges that the destination(s) to which they are travelling may have living standards and practices and standards and conditions with respect to the provision of utilities, services and accommodation, that may differ from those in Canada.</p>
                                <p>Customer shall be responsible for notifying Agency of any special requirements regarding the travel arrangements, including the type of seating/accommodation required and dietary requirements of customer or anyone for whom customer requests Agency to make travel arrangements, at the time of booking the travel arrangements. Agency will make travel suppliers aware of such requests and customer shall be responsible for any additional costs for such requests, however Agency shall not be responsible for any failure to provide such services by the travel suppliers.</p>
                                <p>Agency shall not be liable for any damage or loss suffered by customer or anyone for whom customer requests Agency to make travel arrangements, including the inability to use any of the travel services, as a result of failing to comply with this section.</p>
                                <p>4. Price of Travel Services</p>
                                <p>Prices quoted by Agency for travel services are based on information provided to it by travel suppliers, include all applicable taxes and any contribution to the compensation fund (where applicable) and are subject to change according to travel supplier terms and conditions.</p>
                                <p>5. Payment for Travel Services &amp;Counselling fees and Non-fundable Amounts</p>
                                <p>Customer shall be responsible for payment of all travel services and payment shall be made to the supplier of the travel services. Customer shall be responsible for payment of all counselling fees and payment shall be made to Agency. Customer shall be responsible for payment of all deposits and payment shall be made to Agency. Deposits are non-refundable regardless of whether the travel services are supplied or used and regardless of why the travel services are not supplied or used.</p>
                                <p>Counselling fees are due on the date the travel services are booked and are non-refundable regardless of whether the travel services are supplied or used and regardless of why the travel services are not supplied or used.</p>
                                <p>Agency shall advise customer of dates when payments are due and failure to make payments when due may result in cancellation of the travel services, which will be considered Cancellation by Customer (see below) and all travel supplier and Agency cancellation fees and penalties will apply.</p>
                                <p>6. Change or Cancellation by Travel Supplier</p>
                                <p>The travel services are typically sold well in advance of travel dates and sometimes they are modified or not available. Most often changes to the travel services will be minor, however a travel supplier may make a more significant change, for example a change of time of departure or return by more than 24 hours; change of the standard of the accommodation; increase in the cost of the travel services of more than 7% (unless government imposed); change of route necessitating other identification or documentation when there is insufficient time to meet these requirements before departure; or an error in price. In that case the rights of customer and anyone for whom customer requests Agency to make travel arrangements, shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the travel supplier.</p>
                                <p>7. Change or Cancellation by Customer</p>
                                <p>Customer and anyone for whom customer requests Agency make travel arrangements, must make any change or cancel a booking with Agency and not with a travel supplier.</p>

                                <p>16. Termination of Terms</p>

Failure to make full payment will result in cancellation of the travel services and the provisions of these Terms and the terms conditions of the travel supplier(s) shall apply.</p>
                                <p>In the event of the termination of these Terms, Agency shall be obliged to facilitate the travel arrangements for customer and anyone for whom customer requests Agency make travel arrangements, provided that payment in full for those travel services is received by the date the notice of termination is given.</p>

                                <p>In no event shall Agency be liable for any failure to perform its obligations or delay in performing its obligations where such failure or delay is due to events beyond its control which prevents the performance of its obligations, including without limitation, nuclear or environmental catastrophes; natural disasters and extreme weather conditions; war, invasion, or similar hostilities; rebellion, revolution, insurrection; riots or civil unrest; strikes, lockouts and labour action; acts or threats of terrorism; epidemic, pandemic, or spread of disease; Acts of State or governmental restrictions; and loss or prolonged interruption of necessary utilities, communications or computer services.</p>
                                <p>Customer acknowledges that Agency, on behalf of customer and anyone for whom customer requests Agency make travel arrangements, will forward funds to independent third party travel suppliers, and that once forwarded, these funds may not be recovered and/or refunded. Where a force majeure event has occurred, performance of Agency &#39;s obligations shall be suspended for the duration of the force majeure event, and Agency shall perform its obligations when it is possible to do so.</p>
                                <p>In any event, the liability of Agency arising out of force majeure event shall not exceed amounts paid directly by the customer or anyone for whom customer requests Agency make travel arrangements, to Agency, and Agency shall not be liable for any consequential or indirect damages or legal costs incurred by any party.</p>
                                <p>18. General Provisions</p>
