An evocative, inspiring, and utterly artistic capital of unrivaled cultural impact, Rome is a city of back-to-back landmarks, which will take you on an exhilarating journey through the ages. This may be one of the world &#39;s oldest cities, but it &#39;s well and truly lived in. The ruins are punctuated with murmuring cafes, and the outdoor seating of restaurants sprawls out across piazzas, enticing you to sample tangles of creamy pasta and crispy pizzas. Rome &#39;s incredible Roman Forum is littered with the ruins of its ancient administrations, which have stood firm for 2,000 years, since the times when the area was the center of the Western world. Few sites are more simultaneously beautiful and haunting than that of the storied Colosseum, which looms deep into Rome &#39;s rich blue sky. Take a tour to learn details of the grisly goings-on within. The best way to experience Rome is to wander its streets, gelato in hand. There is a lot to see here - whether it &#39;s the domed spectacle of the Pantheon, or the elaborate flowing waters and artistry of the Trevi Fountain. Vatican City is an astonishing, colossal display of Catholic grandeur, while the Spanish Steps - crowned by the Trinit &agrave;dei Monti church - offer a beautiful spot to gather and soak up the lively atmosphere of this humming city. With so much on the to-do list, you &#39;ll relish the breaks you take, enjoying simple pleasures like a strong espresso, or fresh pasta with tomato sauce and ripped basil.</p>

The city is situated at the northern end of the Gulf of Salerno, near the stunning Amalfi Coast. The old town, rising up the slopes of the hill on the site of the ancient Salernum, still bears evidence of its great days during the medieval period. It had the oldest medical school in Europe, which flourished from the 11th century until it was closed down by Napoleon &#39;s brother-in-law, Murat, in 1812. Today, Salerno &#39;s main attraction is an imposing Romanesque cathedral, built in 1085 and remodeled in the late 18th century. A flight of steps leads up to an atrium with 28 columns from Paestum and fourteen ancient sarcophagi. The magnificent bronze doors were made in Constantinople in 1099. Inside is the ornate tomb of Margaret of Anjou and the tomb of Pope Gregory VII, who died in Salerno in 1085. In the richly decorated crypt under the altar lie the remains of the Evangelist Matthew, brought here from Paestum. A 45-minute walk from the cathedral leads to a hilltop crowned by the old Lombard Castello, from where extensive views are available. Along the seafront, to the east of the harbor, extends a fine promenade lined with impressive modern buildings. The Corso Giuseppe Garibaldi is the town &#39;s principal traffic artery. Salerno is the gateway for travelers for visits to the Greek temples of Paestum. Other favorite excursions from here are to Pompeii and to visit the popular resort towns of Amalfi and Ravello.</p>

However, this world-renowned landmark is but one component of the city &#39;s amazing religious core, the Campo dei Miracoli. Here, the Duomo, Baptistery and Camposanto complete an unrivalled quartet of medieval masterpieces. These and a dozen or so churches and palazzo &nbsp;scattered about the town belong to Pisa &#39;s &#39;Golden Age &#39;, which took place from the 11th to the 13th centuries when the city was still a port, and one of the maritime powers of the Mediterranean.

The sight of it is as stunning today as it must have been to medieval travellers. Nowhere in Italy are the key buildings of a city arrayed with such precision, and nowhere else is there so beautiful a contrast of stonework and surrounding meadow.
                                                                        </p>

Underneath the pavement and turf of the Campo dei Miracoli lies a platform of saturated sandy soil, whose instability accounts for the tilting of the Leaning Tower. Begun in 1173, construction of the tower subsided when it had reached just three storeys in height. Over the ensuing 180 years, a succession of architects continued to extend it upwards until it was finally completed and topped with a bell-chamber in 1350.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                                                        </p>

The Duomo was built in 1064, a century before the Campanile. With its four levels of variegated colonnades and subtle interplay of dark grey marble and white stone, the Duomo is the archetype of the Pisan Romanesque style; a model often imitated but never surpassed.
                                                                        </p>

The third building of the Miracoli ensemble, the circular Baptistery is a bizarre mix; its three storeys of Romanesque arcades peak in a crest of Gothic pinnacles and its dome is shaped like the stalk of a lemon.
                                                                        </p>

Lavish yachts mingle together, seeking out coveted berths in the harbor, while gelato drips onto the stone-paved streets in this, the most alluring and glamorous town of the Italian Riviera. This section of the Ligurian Coast is a protected area, and home to some of the country &#39;s most picturesque, and jaw-dropping scenery - which is best viewed from the deck of a sailing boat. Crisp white villas roll out across the verdant green hillsides, surrounded by laden vineyards and olive groves. Down in Portofino itself, the buzz of chatter and the clatter of cutlery, provide the soundtrack to busy terrace bars and restaurants, which serve up fine food and delicious sea views. Portofino &#39;s achingly beautiful harbor arcs around the lapping waves, with a warmly-hued waterfront of peach and apricot colors - which also adorns postcards and promotional travel guides of Italy. For the authentic Portofino experience, sail out onto the tranquil waters of the Gulf of Tigullio, to mingle amongst the privileged at play, or settle back in the shade as you take aperitivo on the picturesque waterfront Piazzetta. Here you can sip the famous Ligurian wines, and stave off hunger with focaccia con il formaggio - or platters of fine cheese and hams. Deeper into Portofino, you &#39;ll find artisans crafting their wares and weaving together lace, or you can ascend to viewpoints like the lemon-shaded Church of San Giorgio, to look over the pretty jumble from up above. A wander out along the headland to the tapering tip of the peninsular, rewards with the views of Portofino &#39;s iconic white lighthouse beaming out light and welcoming ships to this slice of Riviera heaven.</p>

Physically closer to Rome than Florence, the city is strung to Italy &#39;s western coast by two sandy harnesses and sits on the unique peninsula of Monte Argentario - which was once an island. Flamboyant pink flamingos and herons stroll through the encased lagoon, while Porto Santo Stefano &#39;s waterfront hums with clinking cafes and strolling visitors. The luxury yachts in the harbor show that Porto Santo Stefano has lost none of its luxury appeals, and with beaches, wild hikes, and waterfront beauty, it continues to lure visitors to this secluded escape. Known for its fishing and cuisine - which is based on heavy use of the Tyrrhenian Sea &#39;s juicy bounty. Stroll to Piazza dei Rioni for a dripping lemon gelato, or wander the streets noticing the lingering World War II damage - the city was heavily bombed during the conflict. Fortunately, the historic, star-shaped, Spanish fort was spared, and it still watches out resolutely over the waters. Built during the Napoleonic Wars, it fortified the exposed town against pirate raids and offers beautiful views over the old town &#39;s terracotta roofs. Rugged coastline falls to secluded beaches, with a wilder, unkempt charm. Sail the coves - seeing cascading olive groves - or island hop to Giglio and Giannuti, which lie 12 miles from shore, and can be seen from the monastery-topped Argentario Mountain. On the other side of the promontory, you &#39;ll find Porto Ercole - where the lifeless body of the Old Master, Caravaggio, was discovered.</p>

Bonaparte may be omnipresent in Ajaccio - with statues watching out over palm-tree-lined streets bearing his name - but there is a lot more to this charming city, where an unhurried Mediterranean attitude mixes with the trendy buzz of a French Riviera resort. The stunning setting pairs glowing blue water with a dramatic backdrop of towering, snow-capped peaks. Bonaparte may have been famously short in stature, but he stands as a true giant of history. The National Bonaparte Museum is the ideal place to learn more about his life, in the very house where he was born in 1769. Just inside the modest Cathedral Notre-Dame-de-l &#39;Assomption - surrounded by frescoed walls - you &#39;ll also see the stone font where he was baptized. Elsewhere, the perched watchtower of &Icirc;les Sanguinaires is a short boat ride away, or Plage de Capo di Feno &#39;s stunning, isolated band of white sand and transparent waters may tempt you outside of the historic city. Settle at a restaurant near the harbor to taste succulent wild boar, stewed in rich red wine casserole, or to crack into soft lobster meat. You also have to enjoy the famous fiadone cheesecake made from local brocciu cheese while you &#39;re here, and to let the magic of unique Corsican Polyphony music carry you away. Three singers expertly blend harmonies to create a spine-tingling combination of melody - you &#39;ll notice the distinctive style, as they each cover an ear to focus more clearly on their individual contribution.</p>

For four days the tiny principality bursts into life in Technicolor, for an event that is truly not to be missed. This is the jewel in the crown of Formula One experiences, not just because it is attended by the jet set, celebrities, and royalty alike. For drivers, it is the race they all want to win. But, with the prestige comes added competition, overtaking on the narrow streets is near impossible and speed is strictly controlled. If F1 wasn &rsquo;t cutthroat at the best of times, the Monaco Grand Prix certainly ramps it up to a whole new level. The race takes place on the actual streets of the one-square-mile country &ndash;bringing normal business to a complete standstill. Yet, this is taken by local residents on the chin (all schools and many businesses actually close during the four days), and the party feeling that permeates the Principality for the duration extends to locals and visitors alike. However, if you do need to get away from the madding crowd, the nearby Eze village is a medieval world away from the hustle and bustle. Nice, a short drive away, offers a chance to enjoy a more authentic side of the Riviera. Stroll the gorgeous Promenade des Anglais, shop up a storm in the Old Town, and enjoy the national pastime of watching the world go by. A chilled glass of ros &eacute;in hand, bien sur!</p>
